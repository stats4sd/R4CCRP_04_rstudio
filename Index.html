<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this session, we will guide you through the process of setting up
R and RStudio on your computer, and start familiarising yourself with
good practice for using RStudio. We will cover installing packages,
using projects, and writing scripts using the markdown format. Now that
you have learnt some R code already in the first three sessions,
hopefully it will become a little bit clearer how you can then interact
with RStudio for your own work, and how and why these features are
useful.</p>
<p>This module is a little different to the previous three modules -
there won’t be any interactive code windows in this workbook. Instead
you will be working through this workbook to provide steps which cover
the installation and orientation of R and RStudio on your own
machine.</p>
<p>There are a series of great video resources going along with this
session… but we didn’t produce these ourselves. Rather than reinventing
the wheel here, we are referring to a series of videos by the
statistician Andy Field. The full resource he put together for getting
started with RStudio can be found
<a href="http://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
</div>
<div id="section-installing-r-and-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Installing R and RStudio</h2>
<p>Both R and RStudio are open source software tools, so these can be
downloaded from the internet for free, forever.</p>
<p>Even if you have prior installations of R or RStudio on your computer
- please ensure you download and install the most recent versions of
both programs. R and RStudio are both updated on a very regular basis,
and some of the features we may highlight in this course may not be
available if you are using an older version.</p>
<p><a href="http://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/#section-installing-r-and-rstudio" target="_blank">Video
covering the installation process</a></p>
<p>The first thing to install is the most recent version of R for your
operating system:
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/" target="_blank">Download
R for Windows</a></p>
<p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/" target="_blank">Download
R for Mac</a></p>
<p>Once you have completed the installation of R you can download
RStudio, the link below should provide the recommended link to download
based on your operating system.
<a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download" target="_blank">Download
RStudio</a></p>
<p>You should not need to change any of the default settings as you work
through the installation process. If you are having any issues with the
downloading and installation process please make sure that you have
administrator rights on the computer you are working on. Please remember
that you can use the help forum at any time if you are struggling with
these steps.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-overview-of-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview of R</h2>
<p>It is worth remembering that R is a standalone program that you could
use; and very occasionally when you look up resources online you will
see people using R without using RStudio. This is something that you
will never need to do. But it might be useful to open up R now to see
how things used to be for R users, before RStudio came along. If you
search in your program files you should find it:</p>
<p><img src="images/rlogo.jpg" width="10%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /></p>
<p>Opening R you see a very old fashioned, and quite intimidating
interface! There are very few features within the R GUI to help you get
started, or optimise your workflow at all.</p>
<p>You can see a console window in which you can run write and run
commands. So I could try and see if 2+2 still equals 4:</p>
<p><img src="images/Rinterface.JPG" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>And I can see that R is at least functioning correctly.</p>
<p>The general user un-friendliness is what led to many people making
IDE (Interactive Development Environment) tools, to make working with R
easier. RStudio was not the first of these, but over time it has become
the only method for working with R for the majority of R users.</p>
<p>You can now close down R and head straight over to RStudio.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-overview-of-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview of RStudio</h2>
<p>Andy Field’s video gives you an overview of RStudio that should help
you orientate yourself as a new user to the purpose of each of the
different panes within the RStudio environment.</p>
<p><a href="http://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/#section-a-quick-tour-of-r-studio" target="_blank">A
quick tour of R Studio</a></p>
<p>I’d suggest watching this back-to-back with the next video in the
sequence, which starts moving into more specifics about how you can get
started with some work!</p>
<p><a href="http://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/#section-working-in-rstudio" target="_blank">Working
in RStudio</a></p>
<p>Rather than creating a new file from scratch right now, you can
download the solutions from the intro module as a workbook <a
href="https://github.com/stats4sd/R4CCRP_04_rstudio/raw/main/intro-module-solutions.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>And if you then open this up in RStudio (Using the menu system:
File-&gt;Open File) you can get an idea of how the interface works.</p>
<p>Once opened, your window should look something like this</p>
<p><img src="images/Window.JPG" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>One of the first things I would suggest doing is minimising the
console window. We never want to write commands in the console window
directly - always use some form of a script file so that you can keep a
track of all of the commands you are writing. It’s important to make
sure our work is reproducible, that errors can be easily identified and
fixed, and that we can easily update and build upon what we have done so
far.</p>
<p>If you look at the RMD (R Markdown) file containing the solutions you
can see two distinct types of content on the page. You have text - where
you can write whatever you like. And you have ‘chunks’ of R code, where
you can only write valid R code.</p>
<p>Pressing the green button to the right of the chunk of code will run
the code. The output will then appear directly below the code within the
RMD document.</p>
<p><img src="images/RunningCode.JPG" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Make good use of the spaces between the chunks of code! This is
extremely useful for you to add comments as you work through your
analysis - explaining the logic behind particular steps, or reminding
yourself of key pieces of information.</p>
<p>When you work down to the bottom of the solutions you will reach the
examples where objects were created to solve problems. As you run these
lines you will see things start to appear in the environment window,
showing you all of the user created objects produced in this R
session.</p>
<p><img src="images/objects%20in%20environment.JPG" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-working-with-projects" class="section level2">
<h2>Working with projects</h2>
<p>You can download the solutions for the ggplot part 1 module in RMD
format, and the data file used, in CSV format <a
href="https://github.com/stats4sd/R4CCRP_04_rstudio/raw/main/ggplot-part1-solutions.zip">here</a></p>
<p>This is a good opportunity to learn about working with project files,
importing data, and installing and loading packages.</p>
<p>First of all - we should start by extracting the contents of that zip
file into a sensible folder somewhere on your computer.</p>
<p>Then we can create a new project in RStudio (File-&gt;New Project)
and setting this to an “Existing Folder” - the folder where you just
extracted these files to. As explained in the video, projects are a
really useful way of keeping your work organised, and making it easy to
link to input data files and store output files in a coherent
workflow.</p>
<p>In the files pane, you should now see that this has navigated to the
folder you just assigned the project to. It will also create a new
.RProj file, which is the R project file. If you go away from RStudio,
and come back another time you can reload your session exactly where you
left it by opening this .RProj file. The project file automatically
saves as you work. There is also a project menu in the top right corner
which will let you switch between recently used projects, or create new
projects.</p>
<p>As the file pane should now be showing you the folder where you
extracted the module 2 solutions, you should be able to open it by just
clicking on it.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-installing-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Installing Packages</h2>
<div
id="section-automatically-through-the-install-prompt-at-the-top-of-the-file"
class="section level3">
<h3>Automatically through the ‘install’ prompt at the top of the
file</h3>
<p>When you do this you will probably see a prompt at the top of the RMD
window telling you that the ggplot2 package is used in this script, but
has not been installed.</p>
<p><img src="images/ggplot2%20not%20installed.JPG" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>You will see this message when your file contains a call to
<code>library()</code> but the package inside that function is not
installed.</p>
<p>To install ggplot2 you can then click on the install button at the
top of your page and this will then connect to the CRAN repository to
download it. Check the final message which appears. If you see something
which ends with ‘success’ then the package has installed correctly! If
you see an error message after trying to install a package then you have
run into an issue. Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you come across
issues in this process for package installation at first, as there can
sometimes be firewall, or other compatibility issues, which can be
resolved with a bit of technical support.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-manually-from-the-bottom-right-pane"
class="section level3">
<h3>Manually from the bottom right pane</h3>
<p>It might also happen for some reason that you don’t see the yellow
message at the top of the RMD window - maybe you closed it or clicked
the <em>Don’t show again</em> button. In that case, try running the
library commands. Who knows, maybe the package is already installed. If
it is not, you will see the following type of error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Error in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called ‘ggplot2’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simplest is then to install the package manually by:</p>
<ul>
<li>clicking the <code>Packages</code> tab in the bottom right
pane.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/packges%20tab.JPG" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ul>
<li>clicking the <code>Install</code> button.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/install%20button.JPG" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ul>
<li>typing the name of the package in the ‘Packages’ field, and press
<strong>Install</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/install%20window.JPG" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>You then wait a little and if, as said just above, you see something
which ends with ‘success’ then the package has installed correctly. If
instead you see some error, that’s time to look for help!</p>
<p>You can watch the video about installing and loading packages here:
<a href="http://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/#section-installing-and-loading-packages" target="_blank">Installing
and loading packages</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-markdown-files" class="section level2">
<h2>Markdown Files</h2>
<p>The video introduction for writing R scripts can be found here:
<a href="http://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/#section-r-markdown" target="_blank">R
Markdown</a></p>
<p>If you have set the project file, and installed ggplot2 you should
now be able to go through the solutions file and run each of the chunks
of code to see the ‘solved’ answers. Make sure you work through
sequentially. Loading the packages and the data first, otherwise the
later steps will not run. You can see from the first chunk a new
function <code>read.csv</code> being used to read the data file in. We
will learn more about reading in data in the second part of this module,
but for now you can trust that, as long as you set up your project
correctly, this line will read in the datafile and store it in R as an
object called BeanSurvey. When you run this line you should see it
appear in your environment pane.</p>
<p>And if you click on it within that environment pane, it will open a
(non-editable) spreadsheet like interface to view the data.</p>
<p><img src="images/viewer.JPG" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>When writing your own markdown files there are a few key points to
remember:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Work sequentially! Always start by loading libraries and data;
and put data manipulation steps before moving into analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Unless you are sharing with someone else to try to resolve an
error, don’t keep any code that you couldn’t get to work within the
document. We would like to have clear organisation of our commands, and
not have things included that don’t work. But remember for those
things…</p></li>
<li><p>Use the areas around the code chunks to write explanations and
comments about what you are doing, and why you are doing it.
Particularly if you have come across something new or exciting. Or
(following from pt 2) if you get stuck- you can write comments about
your problems when sharing. Your code may make perfect sense to you now
- but when you come back next week, or next month… or next year, it
might not make so much sense then.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful about breaking the formatting style of the code
chunks, by accidentally modifying or deleting the way they appear. It is
safer to use the “Insert-&gt;R” button from the top right to add in
chunks rather than try to write these out, or copy them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the great things about using R markdown files, is how easy it
is to export results outside of R. As long as you have followed my key
points 1-&gt;4 above, then you should be able to easily convert all of
your output and all of your text into a beautiful report, in your choice
of format (PDF/Word/HTML) by simply pressing the knit button at the top
of the window and selecting the output format. You will always be
prompted to save your document, if there are unsaved changes, before any
output is made.</p>
<p><img src="images/knit.JPG" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /></p>
<p>And the first time you do this you will probably be asked to install
some libraries within R. Try it now using either of the solutions RMD
files that you have downloaded, and should still have open in
RStudio.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to improve on the default appearance of your
output, but going in detail to this is a little beyond the scope of the
course. There are some guides in the resources section of the workbook
which may help you if you are interested in learning more.</p>
<p>You may see online people using the .R format script file, instead of
the .RMD format markdown file. This is an older format for writing R
scripts which does not contain any of the interactive features or the
ability to write and format text outside of R commands. When writing
your own files we strongly recommend using the RMD format. The RMD file
is specific to RStudio - so if you do ever come across a strange person
who uses R but not RStudio (they do exist, but are something of an
endangered species!) they might prefer to use the .R script file instead
of the .RMD markdown file. When you become more of an experienced R
user, you may also find .R script files useful when you are writing code
to create functions or applications, rather than writing code for
working with your own data.</p>
<p>In the next workbook we will cover importing data into R, and you can
then start building your own RMD files from scratch to interact with
R!</p>
